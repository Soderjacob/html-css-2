                <h2>William Shakespear</h2>
                <p>William Shakespeare (c. 23[a] April 1564 - 23 April 1616)[b] was an English playwright, poet and actor. 
                    He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[4][5][6] 
                    He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, 
                    three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. 
                    His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7] Shakespeare 
                    remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.</p>

                <h2>Charles Dickens</h2>
                <p>Charles John Huffam Dickens was an English novelist, journalist, short story writer and social critic.
                    He created some of literature's best-known fictional characters, and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.[1] 
                    His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today.[2][3]</p>

                <h2>George Orwell</h2>
                <p>Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950) was a British novelist, poet, essayist, journalist, and critic who wrote under the pen name of George Orwell, a name inspired by his favourite place River Orwell.[2] 
                    His work is characterised by lucid prose, social criticism, opposition to all totalitarianism (i.e. to both left-wing authoritarian communism and to right-wing fascism), and support of democratic socialism.[3][4]
                    Orwell is best known for his allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945) and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), although his works also encompass literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. 
                    His non-fiction works, including The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England, and Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939),
                    are as critically respected as his essays on politics, literature, language and culture.</p>
